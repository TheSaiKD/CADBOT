Wisdom of the Constitution of India and its makers.

# RAG ChatBot

The RAG Chatbot helps users talk to the makers of the Indian Constitution. This is deployed using Streamlit here: [https://constitutionbot.streamlit.app/](https://constitutionbot.streamlit.app/)

The code for this is app is here: `ragchatbot.py`

I detailed the process I followed in this blog: [Medium](https://medium.com/@saikrishna_17904/e9b75282c54f)

Please feel free to give feedback on improving this. Very happy to work with others as well. Make a PR.

Few more things that have to be done:
- [ ] Conversation instead of a single query.
- [ ] Add more LLM Models.
- [ ] Train Committee reports datasets as well.
